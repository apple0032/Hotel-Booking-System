It is an absolute must-see in the city centre - the palace and the large gardens surrounded by moats and stone walls are simply breath-taking. Come and enjoy a taste of nature within the bustling city.\n\nThe palace occupies the site of an old castle, which used to be the seat of the shogun in the 15th century. It only became the seat of the imperial family in the 19th century, when Emperor Meiji moved the imperial household from Kyoto to Tokyo. Most of what remains of the palace today is only about 50 years old though, as the majority of the old buildings were destroyed during the Second World War.\n\nThe beautiful palace gardens, opened to the public in 1968, are freely accessible at all times. They are especially worth the visit in spring when the cherry trees in the gardens start blossoming.\n\nThe interior of the palace can be visited as well, but only with prior reservation or with one of 300 tickets that are given out every day. There are only a few headsets with information in English though.","provider":null,"translation_provider":null,"link":null,"is_translated":true},"opening_hours_raw":null,"media_count":22,"main_media":{"usage":{"square":"m:77545","video_preview":null,"portrait":"m:77545","landscape":"m:77545"},"media":[{"original":{"size":null,"width":1947,"height":1487},"suitability":["portrait"],"url_template":"https://media-cdn.sygictraveldata.com/media/{size}/612664395a40232133447d33247d383737353435","created_at":"2015-03-17T16:33:15+0000","source":{"provider":"wikipedia","name":"Wikimedia Commons","external_id":null},"type":"photo","created_by":null,"url":"https://media-cdn.sygictraveldata.com/media/612664395a40232133447d33247d383737353435.jpg","quadkey":null,"attribution":{"title_url":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fujimi-yagura_1.jpg","license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","other":null,"author_url":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:WPPilot","author":"WPPilot","title":"Fujimi-yagura (Mt Fuji-view Keep) Imperial Palace Tokyo Japan","license_url":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0"},"location":null,"id":"m:77545"}]},"references":[{"id":14548532,"title":"Wikipedia","type":"wiki","language_id":"en","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Imperial_Palace","supplier":"wiki","priority":0,"currency":null,"price":null,"flags":[]},{"id":13026710,"title":"Official Website","type":"link:official","language_id":null,"url":"http://sankan.kunaicho.go.jp/","supplier":null,"priority":0,"currency":null,"price":null,"flags":[]},{"id":14550880,"title":"About Tokyo/Chiyoda","type":"guide","language_id":"en","url":"https://guides.travel.sygic.com/production/en/Tokyo/Chiyoda","supplier":"wikivoyage","priority":503,"currency":null,"price":null,"flags":["destination_menu"]}],"external_ids":[{"id":"Q500681","type":"wikidata","language_id":null},{"id":"en:Tokyo Imperial Palace","type":"wikipedia","language_id":"en"},{"id":"relation:7676266","type":"osm","language_id":null}],"collection_count":0,"satellite":null},{"id":"poi:19820","level":"poi","rating":1.3496529699637,"rating_local":2.1471749449201734,"quadkey":"133002112303113331320","location":{"lat":35.6585791,"lng":139.7454459},"bounding_box":{"south":35.6580427,"west":139.7447459,"north":35.6591227,"east":139.7461594},"name":"Tokyo Tower","name_suffix":"Tokyo, Japan","original_name":"東京タワー","url":"https://go.sygic.com/travel/place?id=poi:19820","duration":2700,"marker":"sightseeing:architecture:modern","categories":["sightseeing"],"parent_ids":["city:865324","city:846468","city:1073546","city:864790","city:2585","region:2009424","poi:36125237","poi:36368651","country:75","continent:4"],"perex":"Looking at this tower, you may think for a moment that you found yourself in Paris.","customer_rating":null,"star_rating":null,"star_rating_unofficial":null,"thumbnail_url":"https://media-cdn.sygictraveldata.com/media/poi:19820","tags":[{"key":"Lookout","name":"Lookout"},{"key":"Tower","name":"Tower"},{"key":"Observation Deck","name":"Observation Deck"},{"key":"Modern Architecture","name":"Modern Architecture"},{"key":"Aerial Views","name":"Aerial Views"}],"area":4820,"address":"4 Chome-2-8 Shibakoen, Minato, Tokyo 105-0011, Japan","admission":"Main Observatory/Top Deck Observatory:\nAdults: 900 JPY/2800 JPY\nStudents: 500 JPY/1800 JPY\nChildren (4+): 400 JPY/1200 JPY","email":null,"opening_hours":"Main observatory (150m): \nDaily: 9 am - 11 pm\n(Last admission 30 min before closing)\n\nTop Deck Observatory (250m):\nDaily: 9 am - 10:45 pm\n(Las admission 30 min before closing)\n\nThe main deck is currently under renovation, please check the official website for more information.","is_deleted":false,"phone":"+81 3 3433 5111","description":{"text":"Looking at this tower, you may think for a moment that you found yourself in Paris.
